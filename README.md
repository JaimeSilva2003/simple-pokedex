# simple-pokedex
Simple pokedex project using Vite+React+Axios and pokeapi
Took me about 5 to 7 hours to complete this project as I never used React.
Started by doing some research on how to use React and eventually discovered that it would be best to go with Vite as it is a faster development tool for React.
As I progressed I decided to use Axios as an alternative to using fetch for making the HTTP requests.

HOW TO RUN:
- extract zip file;
- if the folder "node_modules" is missing, go on the project's directory and do npm install on the terminal (command prompt)
- then do npm run dev on the same terminal
- then open the link that is provided, eg.: "http://localhost:5173"

Used multiple forums and these videos for my reaserch and as a basis:
